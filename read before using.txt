dear redditors (male), dear redditors (female);
i finished this masterpiece after 2 long days of no-stop work.
pls understand that i am a web developer and that the first time using pyhton so hope it explains that i
take extra-time coding this project.

requirement: install selenuim by writing "pip install selenuim" command on terminal after installing "pyhton".
the chromedriver is already installed but if you are using another chrome version (not the Chrome 89 version) pls install
your chrome driver here :: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

usage is kinda easy, you should replace the "replace me i am useless" text in the code of each file 
with the target mail adress, and the username in the gaysite;.py file.
The name of each file is how much mails will the target receive. 
if there is some bugs or questions or suggestions of links pls email me on med.amine.ennouri1@gmail.com, or on disord
